# Weather Tracker 
Weather Tracker powered by the Open Weather API. Open Weather API is used to pull the live weather outlook for multiple cities, so users can plan accordingly before going outside. Once you enter the city in the search input, a brief overview of todays forecast will appear on the top right, and a five day forecast on the bottom right. Each time you enter a new city, the search history is updated to the current input. Have Fun!
